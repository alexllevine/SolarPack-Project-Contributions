# Brightness Sensitity Measure

To assess the performance of our solar cells, we need to measure the brightness of the surrounding daylight. This helps us determine if the solar cells are underperforming. To achieve this, we will connect a photodiode to the analog output (AO) on the P2. Additionally, we will add a capacitor to minimize voltage ripples and spikes, and include a resistor to keep the current low.
